Takes a tuple of the form (:symbol, arg, arg) and a dictionary mapping symbols
to struct types, and returns an instantiation of the struct named by :symbol.
We pass in the list of datatypes because, if we didn't, then instantiation
of a type from a symbol would need to search for the correct constructor
in the correct module, and that would be both wrong and slow.

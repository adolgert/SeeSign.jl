# Plan
 
## Current Features
 
1. Rule-based events
1. Sampling methods
1. Dirac delta function times (for ODEs)
 
## Immediate Features
 
1. Deterministic
   * Ferret out uses of Set that cause randomization.
1. Re-enabling of events
1. Rules that depend on events instead of just states.
   * Macro and struct for event(key)
1. Observers on events
1. Observers of state changes
1. Immediate events

## Future features

1. Importance sampling
1. Pregeneration of all rule-based events.
1. Transactional firing (for estimation of derivatives)
1. HMC sampling from trajectories

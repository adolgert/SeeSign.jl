# # Getting Started with SeeSign.jl
#
# This is an example of using Literate.jl to create executable documentation.
# 
# SeeSign.jl is a simulation framework built on top of CompetingClocks.jl
# for event-driven simulations with dependency tracking.

# ## Basic Usage
#
# First, let's import the package:

using SeeSign

# ## Simple Example
#
# Here's how you would set up a basic simulation:
# (This is just an example structure - you'll replace this with actual working code)

println("This is a placeholder example for Literate.jl integration")

# ## Next Steps
#
# As you develop more examples, you can add them as `.jl` files in the `literate_src/` directory.
# They will be automatically converted to markdown and included in the documentation.
